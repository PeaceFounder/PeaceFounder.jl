To assert that votes have been  accuratelly counted and that only legitimate voters have participated an audit takes place.\n\nEvery voter after ellections receives a final tally together with a consistency proof  which proves that their vote is included in the ledger which have produced the tally.  From the voter client voter reads four important parameters for the ballotbox:\n\ndeme_uuid: an UUID of the deme where the proposal is registered;\nproposal_index: a index at which the proposal is recorded in the braidchain ledger;\nledger_length: a number of collected votes in the ledger;\nledger_root: a ballotbox ledger root checksum.\n\nThe auditor also knows a hasher deme uses to make checksums which is immutable at the moment deme is created.\n\nLet's consider abstract functions to retrieve ballotbox and braidchain ledger archives from the internet with get_ballotbox_archive and get_braidchain_archive then the auditing can be done with a following script:\n\nbraidchain_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid)\nballotbox_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid, proposal_index)[1:ledger_length]\n\n@test checksum(ballotbox_archive, hasher) == ledger_root\n@test isbinding(braidchain_archive, ballotbox_archive, hasher)\n\nspec = crypto(braidchain_archive)\n\n@test audit(ballotbox_archive, spec)\n@test audit(braidchain_archive)\n\n@show tally(ballotbox_archive)\n\nNote that spec is read from the DemeSpec record in the braidchain which can be trusted as  the tree braidchain ledger checksum is listed within a proposal's anchor. The proposal is  the first record in history tree for the ballotbox thus it is bound to ledger_root  checksum and so demespec record is also tied to ledger_root.\n\nFor convinience an audit method is provided which audits both archives at the same time:\n\nbraidchain_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid)\nballotbox_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid, proposal_index)[1:ledger_length]\n\n@test checksum(ballotbox_archive, hasher) == ledger_root\n@test audit(braidchain_archive, ballotbox_archive, hasher)\n\n@show tally(ballotbox_archive)\n\nNote that this audit does not check honesty of the registrar that it have not admitted fake users to gain more influence in the ellection result. Properties being verified by the audit:\n\nLegitimacy: only and all eligiable voters cast their votes;\nFairness: every eligiable voter can vote at most once;\nImmutability: no vote can be deleted or modified when recorded in the ledger; \nTallied as Cast: all cast votes are counted honestly to predetermined procedure; \nSoftware independence: the previously audited properties for the evidence does not \n\ndepend on a trust in honest execution of peacefounder service nor honesty of the braiders who provides new pseudonyms for the deme members. In other words the previously listed  properties would not be altered if adversary would have a full control over the peacefounder  service and the braiders. \n\nThe immutability is ensured from voter's clients updating their consistency proof chain which includes their vote. If the vote gets removed from a chain every single voter who had cast their vote would get a proof for inconsistent ledger state called blame. The blame can be made public by the voter without revealing it's vote and thus ensures immutability and also persitance after votes are published. The auditable part here are the votes themselves signed with pseudonym which contract voter's clients to follow up at latter periods with consistency proofs. On top of that, other monitors can synchronize the ballotbox ledger and add assurances that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"audittools/#PeaceFounder.Core.AuditTools.BallotBoxArchive","page":"PeaceFounder.Core.AuditTools","title":"PeaceFounder.Core.AuditTools.BallotBoxArchive","text":"struct BallotBoxArchive\n    proposal::Proposal\n    seed::Digest\n    ledger::Vector{CastRecord}\nend\n\nRepresents a ballotbox ledger archive.

To mitigate such risks, deploying multiple collectors, to which voters are randomly pre-assigned, is advised.

Therefore, the response status needs to be asymmetrically encrypted.

If the submitted vote is not final, the collector encrypts a group element representing status addressed to the pseudonym that cast the vote.

However, as evident with comprehensive surveys, there is a noticeable decline in response rates as the number of questions escalates. Further complicating matters is the phenomenon known as the 'voter's paradox,' wherein the impact of a singular vote diminishes in larger elections. Both challenges can be addressed by sharding lengthy ballots among the entire voter base. ","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"In the PeaceFounder system, sharding is trivial due to votes being cast pseudonymously. The initial step in the sharding involves determining all feasible divisions of the ballot and methodically enumerating them. Subsequently, these shards are allocated to pseudonyms, achieved by systematically sorting and matching them in sequence.","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"Nevertheless, a pronounced security concern emerges. Suppose an adversary assumes control over the proposer and possesses knowledge of a select group of pseudonym owners and their inclinations.

Specifically, critical questions can be allocated to a limited cohort, skewing results in their favour.","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"To counteract this vulnerability, it's imperative for the proposer to commit to both the ballot and its associated shards, followed by a lottery to randomise the pseudonym list. Leveraging a DRAND service, which collaborates with multiple entities to execute threshold decryption, ensures the generation of predetermined, incorruptible random numbers [...]. These numbers subsequently serve as salt for hashing pseudonyms, which are sorted and allocated to shards accordingly. A critical aspect of this method is making sure the proposal is committed before the lottery result is announced to prevent adversaries from taking advantage of waiting for a favourable lottery outcome. This necessitates the involvement of auditors/monitors to timestamp the braidchain ledger commitments externally.","category":"page"},{"location":"#PeaceFounder.jl","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"(Image: ) (Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"PeaceFounder is a centralised E2E verifiable e-voting system that leverages pseudonym braiding and history trees.

Meanwhile, pseudonym braiding done via an exponentiation mix before the vote allows anonymisation to be transactional with a single braider at a time. In contrast to existing E2E verifiable e-voting systems, it is much easier to deploy as the system is fully centralised, free from threshold decryption ceremonies, trusted setup phases and bulletin board replication.

They all encrypt and mix votes through a re-encryption shuffle and use a threshold decryption ceremony. This allows voters to track their encrypted votes and the public to verify the final tally. However, it depends on the integrity of the bulletin board and the coordination of the threshold decryption ceremony, presenting challenges for smaller communities and organisations.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"To make a point, let's consider a Helios voting system. The vote in Helios is stored in a group element, encrypted and signed by a digital signature provider, and then submitted to the bulletin board. When the vote closes, votes go through the reencryption shuffle and are decrypted in the threshold decryption ceremony. Voters can ensure that their vote has been counted by finding their encrypted vote within the list of inputs of the mix cascade. Furthermore, everyone can verify the final tally by counting the decrypted votes and verifying supplemented zero-knowledge proofs without compromising privacy. In this way, the integrity of the election result can be assured.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"However, issues like forced abstention and potential vote substitution of unverified votes can happen if authorities are corrupt and auditing/monitoring does not occur. Publishing vote-casting signatures can alleviate many of those issues, but that violates participation privacy. The threshold decryption ceremony further compounds the system's complexity; if more than a few are corrupt, votes can remain encrypted, while a low threshold risks privacy breaches. These factors, coupled with the technical intricacies of deployment, make Helios less feasible for small to medium-sized communities, leading to a preference for simpler black box systems to prevent questions from being asked, which can foster trust at the expense of trustworthiness.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"A significant improvement over Helios is the Selene system, which offers a voter-assigned tracking number and shows their votes next to them after the vote. Recent usability studies with Selene have demonstrated that voters appreciate the ability to verify their vote in plaintext. This allows them to discard their trust in advanced cryptography as they can see how their vote is counted. As the tracking number is not published before the vote and is deniable, it is also coercion-resistant. In addition to clever cryptography, it can also detect malware interference. However, the threshold decryption ceremony still needs to be deployed along with the bulletin board and thus would generally suit only state-like elections.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"Haenni & Spycher proposed a system using exponentiation mixes to anonymise voters' pseudonyms, eliminating the need for a threshold decryption ceremony. However, the benefits of such a system have yet to be reaped as it requires a trusted bulletin board that does not discard unfavourable votes; thus, deployment of such a system needs to be distributed and hence offers minor deployment improvements over Helios. Furthermore, over 13 years, a single open-source system has yet to be implemented.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"The innovative approach by PeaceFounder combines pseudonym braiding developed by Haenni & Spycher with a history trees-enabled bulletin board (Crosby & Wallach). When voters cast their vote, their devices receive inclusion proof of the vote, which can later be verified to be binding to the tally with consistency proof. By having only a few voters who request their device to check the proofs, the immutability of the bulletin board is guaranteed. Thus, once the server has assured that the vote is recorded, there is no way for it to be removed. This allows the system to be fully centralised and, thus, makes it easy to self-host.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"However, such a system poses many challenges compared to the orthodox approach. To protect against a corrupt server that discards unfavourable votes, voters must have the option to route the vote through proxy/monitor, which adds a challenge with coercion/bribery. To reap the benefits of braiding pseudonyms with any other community/organisation worldwide, the voters must be registered long before the vote starts, which would produce a bad user experience. Therefore, disengaging anonymisation from voting requires long-standing accounts, which poses an issue for continuous member registration and termination; on top of that, the votes need to be delivered over an anonymous channel not to be traceable by a corrupt authority.
